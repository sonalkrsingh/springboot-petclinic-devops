# DevSecOps CI/CD Pipeline with Azure DevOps 🚀

This repository demonstrates a complete **CI/CD pipeline** implementation using **Azure DevOps**, covering phases from code integration to secure deployment, aligned with DevSecOps best practices.

---

## 🏗️ Application Architecture

![Application Architecture](src/petclininc_app_architecture.jpg)

## 📌 Project Goals

- Automate code build, test, and deployment pipelines.
- Perform **Static Application Security Testing (SAST)** and **Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST)**.
- Integrate **SonarQube**, **JFrog Artifactory**, **Azure Blob Storage**, **Docker Hub**, and **Azure Container Registry (ACR)**.
- Deploy across multiple environments: **Staging**, **Production**, and **Azure Container Instance (ACI)**.

---

## 🔄 CI/CD Pipeline Overview

### 1. **Continuous Integration (CI)**

- ✅ Code Commit & Merge (GitHub → Azure Repos)
- ✅ **SAST** via SonarQube
- ✅ Build with Maven (skipping tests where needed)
- ✅ Docker image creation
- ✅ Artifact upload to:
  - Azure Blob Storage
  - AWS S3
  - JFrog Artifactory

### 2. **Continuous Delivery (CD)**

- ✅ Automated deployments to **Development** and **Staging**
- ✅ Manual approvals where required
- ✅ Integration testing environment readiness

### 3. **Continuous Deployment (CD)**

- ✅ Production push (manual approval step)
- ✅ Azure Container Instance (ACI) Deployment
- ✅ Verification via Route 53 subdomains (e.g., `staging.cloudvishwakarma.in`)
